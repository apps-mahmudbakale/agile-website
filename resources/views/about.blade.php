            <p style="line-height: 50px; text-align:justify;">The AGILE Project works with the Federal Government of Nigeria
                and supports Kano State to improve secondary education opportunities among adolescent girls. It aims to
                achieve this through targeted intervention on the key economic principles of demand and supply, as well as
                the systemic constraints that militate against girls’ education.</p>
